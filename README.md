# new.css for WordPress

A lightweight, minimalist WordPress theme based on [new.css](https://newcss.net).

## Installation

This theme is not (yet) available in the WordPress Theme directory. There's some work to do so it can pass the theme review requirements. In the meantime, download the [latest release package](https://github.com/davidmytton/new.css-wordpress/releases), then extract it into your `wp-content/themes` directory. It will then show up in your WordPress Admin under the Appearance > Themes section.

## Example

[My blog](https://davidmytton.blog) is running this theme.

## new.css Modifications

The stylesheet is slightly modified for readability on a blog. The modifications are implemented by overriding the CSS in [header.php](/header.php).
